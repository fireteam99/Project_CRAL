## Description

This directory contains functions that are run when a CLI command is recieved. Most of them accept an `cmdObj` object as an argument. The `cmdObj` contains information about what flags/arguments were passed by the user as given by Commander.js (more info [here](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/#action-handler)).
